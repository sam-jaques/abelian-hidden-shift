# Quantum Abelian Hidden Shift Algorithm Simulator

This simulates Kuperberg's algorithm from [Another subexponential-time quantum algorithm for the dihedral hidden subgroup problem
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.3333). The main quantum step involves only a fourier sample, and this is easy to simulate with knowledge
of the hidden shift. 

This simulator currently only simulates cyclic groups with order equal to a power of 2, though many methods would work 
with other smooth orders. The next step for this is to support any order of group using an approximate collimation technique.

## Use


### Prerequisites

Python 2.7.

### Importing

Following the example of kuperbergtest.py, import as follows:

```
from kuperberg import HiddenShiftProblem
from kuperberg import PhaseState
```

###Full Simulation
First, instantiate a hidden shift problem:
```
test_problem=HiddenShiftProblem(group_order,[phi_1,phi_2,phi_3],secret_shift)
```
Here the group order is group_order, the array [phi_1,phi_2,phi_3] represents the endomorphisms
phi (see Section 3.2 of Kuperberg's paper), which must be coprime to the group order.

To run the full recursive algorithm, call:
```
low_height_state=test_problem.sample_of_height(2)
```
This samples states and collimates them until it reaches the input height (in this case, 2).
It outputs a phase state, as an object of the class PhaseState.

###States
The PhaseState class represents individual states.

One can print out the main features of the state:
```
low_height_state.display()
```
The height of a state in this program is equal to 2^h for the height h used in Kuperberg's paper.

One can try to "balance" the state:
```
balanced_state=low_height_state.balance()
```
This returns a state with an injective b-function, or returns "false" if the simulated measurement fails.

If it has length 2, a state can also be measured in the +,- basis:
```
balanced_state.measure()
```
which returns 1 or 0.

###Collimating

The other main function is 
```
collimate(phase_state_array,M)
```
which performs the collimation subroutine. Here the phase_state_array is an array of PhaseState objects,
from the same HiddenShiftProblem. It can be array of size 1. 

The M is slightly different than what Kuperberg defines m to be. In his paper, collimation reduces 
a state of "height" 2^h to 2^m. This routine reduces a state of height h to h/M. Hence, M must 
divide the heights of all the input states. 

## Other Notes

Since the original paper did not explicitly optimize the choice of M, the reduction at each step,
I chose to set M to be the square root of the remaining height. This roughly matches the original
parameterization but is unlikely to be optimal.

To change this parameterization, you need to provide three things:
 * an array of height targets to recursively hit
 * a dictionary that maps height targets to the value of M to use at that height
 * a dictionary that maps height targets to length targets
These should be constructed in the `build_params` method of HiddenShiftProblem. 

Please let me know if you improve this.
